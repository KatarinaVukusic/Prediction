# Prediction_of_heart_disease

## Introduction

Croatia is considered to be in the third phase of epidemiological transition (35%-65% of total mortality from cardiovascular diseases). The most important diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is coronary heart disease (CHD). Worldwide, approximately 80%-90% of patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease and more than 95% of patients who died from the disease had at least one of the four traditional risk factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia). A data set with risk factors and a modeling process for logistic regression will be presented in Jupyter Notebook. Whole app is created with Streamlit. 

## Short description 

In this project, model of logistic regression was used to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. The data set was collected from the Framinghon Heart Disease Study and it is used to build the model. This project is created with Streamlit (open-source app framework for Machine Learning). A data set with risk factors and a modeling process for logistic regression will be presented in Jupyter Notebook.
